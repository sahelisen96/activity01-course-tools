## Activity 01 - Day 01
### Saheli Sen

**The below meme I've chosen to describe my emotion on the first day of the school as well as first class.
I was pretty much excited and enthusiastic for the 
first class of this semester and to meet some known faces again.**


**The energy level rises when the professor announces there is no pressure on homework and grading.
I enjoyed the interactive session among the classmates too.
It gave me the opportunity to know about people's perspectives on personal identities.
I hope the rest of the semester will be as smooth as the first class.**
